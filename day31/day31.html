    <p>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p>

    <h2 style="color:blueviolet">web server</h2>
    <p>A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.</p>

    <p>The end user processes a request via a web browser installed on a web server. The communication between a web server or browser and the end user takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The primary role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver requested information or webpages to end users. It uses:

        Physical Storage: All website data is stored on a physical web server to ensure its safety. When an end user enters the URL of your website or searches it using a keyword on a browser, a request is generated and sent to the web server to process the data.
        
        Web browser: The role of web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer is to find the web server on which your website data is located. Once the browser finds your server, it reads the request and processes the information.</p>
